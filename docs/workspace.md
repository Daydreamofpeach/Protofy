# ðŸ’¼ Workspace
![workspace-sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Protofy-xyz/Protofy/assets/events/events-1.png)
The workspace (or admin panel) is the place where you can create and manage your pages, apis, devices, etc. This panel is a Next.js app that runs on port `3000` by default, but with our Redbird proxy runs in `8080` port.

> Remeber that you need to have a user with `admin` type to be able to access the workspace.

The workspace has two main sections: **Sidebar** and **Section Preview**.
