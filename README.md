# Protofy Starter

An Open Source Low Code starter for creative minds.

## üî¶ About

This monorepo is a starter for a Low-Code enabled web/app with an API system and real time message.

Based on: Protofy (protoflow + visualui) + Expo + Next.js + Tamagui + Solito + Express + Aedes + Redbird

Many thanks [@natew] for creating the original starter and to [@FernandoTheRojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for the Solito starter monorepo which the original natew starter was forked from. Check out Fernando Rojo his [talk about using expo + next together at Next.js Conf 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lnbdRweJtA).

## üì¶ Included packages
- Protoflow
- VisualUI
- Protofy Admin Panel
- Express API system
- Aedes mqtt server
- Redbird http reverse proxy
- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) ü™Ñ
- [solito](https://solito.dev) for cross-platform navigation
- Expo SDK
- Next.js
- Expo Router

## üóÇ Folder layout

The main apps are:

- `expo` (native)
- `next` (web)
- `api` (express API to create the web or app)
- `admin-api` (express API with the admin API)

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `common` includes shared code, like entities, validators, etc
  - `ui` includes your custom UI kit that will be optimized by Tamagui
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
  - `protolib` Protofy react library with high level widgets and functions to bootstrap the web/app creation
  - `protoflow` Protofy react library to draw js/ts/jsx/tsx as diagrams
  - `visualui` Protofy react library to do WYSIWYG in react

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

- The first time you should run: `node prepare.js` to initialize submodules (protoflow, protolib and visualui)
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- local dev: `yarn start-dev`

To run with optimizer on in dev mode (just for testing, it's faster to leave it off): `yarn web:extract`. To build for production `yarn start-prod`.

## UI Kit

Note we're following the [design systems guide](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems) and creating our own package for components.

See `packages/ui` named `@my/ui` for how this works.

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

## Update new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

```sh
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).

You may potentially want to have the native module transpiled for the next app. If you get error messages with `Cannot use import statement outside a module`, you may need to use `transpilePackages` in your `next.config.js` and add the module to the array there.
