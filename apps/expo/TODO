can't use any '@my/ui' component or even 'tamagui' component 
due that some exported components of the library use inline environment variables.

To use inline environment variables you should set up the config at Babel (babel.comfig.js).
If add line 'transform-inline-environment-variables' at babel config then crash whole expo app
